# N-Queens Problem

## Description

The N-Queens problem involves placing `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. The goal of this project is to solve the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.
